Based on the current Notion portfolio, I want to make a web-based portfolio based on that but using a game-theme with a character in the character.png file. Below are detaied ideas/ changes I want to do

# Step 1:
Go into https://hienbach.notion.site/Professional-Portfolio-1a199e5c332a45669fe86014824746ae#febac7ebbd10409ca3cab334dde18d36

# Step 2:
Read the logic from the page


# Step 4:
Keep the current format for About Me

# Step 5:
For the part having three cards (6 internship completed, 15+ project completed, 3.9+ completed) and achievements, I want to create a layout like the complete.png file as inspiration, but replace "COMPLETE" with "ACHIEVEMENTS". Below that, convert each card of cards (6 internship completed, 15+ project completed, 3.9+ completed) into each trophy with the number inside. Below those three trophies, there should be the four cards for achievements.

# Step 6:
For skills, keep software skills only and turn each bucket into the icon instead. For example, 'Python' should be turned into an python software icon. If you don't have a logo/ icon for that, I'll help you add on later.

# Step 7:
Turn the Experiences into a journey map like the journey_map.png file as inspiration, each circle node represents for each internship. My character will be at the current internship which is with the New York Times. After that node, will be some node with locked icon and the final destination flag at the end.

# Step 8:
I want to add a Project section but haven't had any ideas yet. You can design this project section in your favor.

# Step 9:
Create html, css, javascript files
